			   ARGUMENT PASSING

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

None. The modifications were done at the local scope.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing.  How do
>> you arrange for the elements of argv[] to be in the right order?
>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?

Most of the code is implemented in the setup_stack() function. Firstly, in the
load() function, we tokenized the file_name and processed them into argv and argc which were
then passed to the modifed setup_stack().

Then in the setup_stack, we have done the following operation on the stack:
1. Pushing the arguments into the stack in a growing downward manner.
2. Adding the word align
3. Pushing a null pointer sentinel.
4. Pushing all the addresses of the arguments onto the stack.
5. Pushing argv to the stack which has the address of argv[0].
6. Pushing the number of arguments passed (argc).
7. Pushing the fake return address.

While adding the arguments to the stack, we ensure they are added in the reverse order by iterating the arguments backward so that
the first token we get is the last argument. At each iteration, we decrement the esp pointer by the size of the number of bytes of
the data type.

We calculate the stack length at the end of the operations and if the stack length is greater than the PG_SIZE, then we return false to avoid stack overlow. 

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?

strtok() uses global data and this could be unsafe in threaded programs 
such as kernels. The context pointer that is provided by the caller as 
part of strtok_r() is used to store state between calls instead of using 
a global variable.

>> A4: In Pintos, the kernel separates commands into a executable name
>> and arguments.  In Unix-like systems, the shell does this
>> separation.  Identify at least two advantages of the Unix approach.

1. In UNIX, kernel doesnt take care of the parsing of arguments and this happens at the user level. This 
saves time at the kernel level and also avoids any unexpected crashes at the kernel level thus making it more robust.

2. Custom command checks can be put in place and some processing/validations can be done beforehand making it more flexible.

>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?

   File descriptors have a one on one association with each file called/opened through syscall The file descriptors
   are unique within the entire OS.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the
>> kernel.

   Read: First we will verify if the file, buffer and the size are valid pointers. We do the memory validation 
   and ensure buffer+0 and buffer + 4 are valid.  If not, we do a system exit. If it is an input, we iterate over 
   the length of the size variable and take input into the buffer. Else, we will read the existing file using 
   the file read. If there is no such file or the file couldnt be opened, we return -1.

   Write: The write process is similar to the read. Firstly, we verify if the file, buffer and the size are 
   valid pointers. We do the memory validation and ensure buffer+0 and buffer + 4 are valid. If not, we do a 
   system exit. There are two cases here. If it is a write to stdout, we use putbuf to print the content of 
   the buffer to the console. Else, we will write the content to the file using file_write. If there is no 
   such file or the file couldnt be opened, we return -1.

   If the system call causes a full page of data to be copied,
   
   The greatest number could be 4096 if its not continous as we may have to check every address to ensure
   there is valid access. If it is continous, the greatest number would be 2 as we have to check the start 
   and the end adddress and check if they are mapped.

   The least number would be 1 as in the very first result, we obtain the required result, there is no need 
   to inspect anymore. 

   If the system call causes 2 bytes of data to be copied,

   The greatest number will be 2 if it is not continuous as we have to inspect where the other byte is present.
   The lowest number would be 1 if it is continuous.    

 
>> B5: Briefly describe your implementation of the "wait" system call
>> and how it interacts with process termination.

The wait (pid) system call finds pid among the child processes of the current process and waits until it is terminated. The children_list stores all the child processes of the current thread and is traversed to find the pid, also it returns -1 if not found.  Also, we can check if the child process has already ended or it is waiting by looking at the process_done and process_waiting fields in the pcb. If the child process has not yet terminated, the current thread will call the child process' exit() and the parent has to wait until termination finishes(sema_wait is used to achieve this). From the child's perspective, the process_done is set to true. In process_exit(), the resources occupied by this process are first released. Finally, we signal sema_wait as discussed before in case if any parent process is waiting. With this flow, the wait() and exit() system calls interact.

   All the addresses/pointers are verified to ensure they are not null by calling is_valid_address() method which 
   takes in two parameters. One is the variable whose pointer we would verify and the other is the data size of 
   that variable. We iterate over the size essentially until the end of the pointer and ensure there is no segfault error.
   Essentially, before we add each pointer to the sructure, we call is_valid_address().

   For example, if we consider the SYS_WRITE system call, we call is_valid_address() on the esp pointer. It foresees 
   the three addresses above this(we call is_valid_address three times on esp) and determines if there is a seg fault
   error. If there is an error, we perform system exit.  

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B7: The "exec" system call returns -1 if loading the new executable
>> fails, so it cannot return before the new executable has completed
>> loading.  How does your code ensure this?  How is the load
>> success/failure status passed back to the thread that calls "exec"?

When process_execute runs it creates a semaphore and decrements it. It then starts the child process and tries
to decrement again. After load() has been called on the new executable, the semaphore gets incremented. This ensures that exec 
does not return until load() is executed. The child thread then blocks to allow the parent thread to inspect the child thread's load_status.

>> B8: Consider parent process P with child process C.  How do you
>> ensure proper synchronization and avoid race conditions when P
>> calls wait(C) before C exits?  After C exits?  How do you ensure
>> that all resources are freed in each case?  How about when P
>> terminates without waiting, before C exits?  After C exits?  Are
>> there any special cases?

Since the currently implemented filesystem does not have internal synchronization, it is recommended that only one process access the filesystem.
To ensure, locks must be held before and after system calls that access files. The lock used at this time is in syscall.c.
It is declared as fs_lock, including exec() (because load() internally accesses the file system)
Acquire a lock before executing a file system related system call, and release the lock afterward (including failure).


---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>> kernel in the way that you did?

We have choosen the method two from section 4.7 (Accessing User Memory) 
in the PA2_Description_2020.pdf. When we are accessing the user memory 
from the kernel, we should check if the address sent by the user program
is correct. First we check if the user address is less than PHYS_BASE,then 
we use the get_user() to read a byte at user virtual address UADDR and it 
returns the byte value if successful. However, if it is an invalid memory 
area, -1 should be returned as a segfault would have occurred. Since all 
user memory accesses go through this function, it checks if it is the correct 
memory access. So, finally we choose this method as this method takes advantage 
of the processor's MMU and it tends to be used in real kernels as specified in
the PDF.


>> B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>> for file descriptors?

The advantages of our implementation are that our file descriptor design is simpler and also we do not impose any limitation on the number of    files that can be opened. however, the latter can also be considered as a disadvantage if seen from a time complexity perspective as we have to loop through all the files to search for a particular struct with a given file descriptor. We have also defined a helper function to find the file_descriptor struct based on the file descriptor number which made the operations simpler and easily searchable. Also, this can lead to elevated consumption of kernel space if the user program tries to open a lot of files.

>> B11: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.
>> If you changed it, what advantages are there to your approach?

We maintain the default mapping between pid_t and tid_t, with identity function.
We didn't change it.
